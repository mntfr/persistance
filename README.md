# Persistance searcher
## Based on the numberphile video "What's special about 277777788888899?"

This code will try every combination in order to see if it has persistance greater or equal to 11
This code will run forever unless is stopped
The logic is based on the limits given in the video:
1. Current search space is 230 digits
2. Small combinations of 1, 2, 3 or 4 as the first digits
3. Rest of the number is 7, 8 or 9
4. No 5 or 6

Fixed the recursion algorithm given in the video
For python 3.x
